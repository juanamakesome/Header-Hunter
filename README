Overview
Header Hunter is a Python-based inventory intelligence tool designed to automate purchasing decisions for high-volume retail environments. It processes raw inventory reports using customizable risk logic (via business_rules.py) to generate optimized procurement orders, minimizing stockouts and overstock risks.

Key Value Proposition: Demonstrates the core workflow of a Merchant Risk Analyst:
Ingest Data → Validate Integrity → Apply Risk Logic → Automate Decision

Architecture & Tech Stack
Core Logic: Python 3.10+
Data Processing: Pandas (Dataframes), OpenPyXL (Excel Automation)
Architecture: Modular design separating Business Logic from Data Ingestion

Key Modules (Risk Analysis Focus)
File	Function	Analogy
business_rules.py	Defines reordering thresholds (e.g., "If < 2 weeks supply, buy")	Underwriting Policy: Defining the "Credit Box" for approval
hh_logic.py	Decision engine processing velocity vs. stock levels	Risk Modeling: Calculating stockout probability (Default)
excel_validation.py	Cleans raw reports (null values, invalid formats)	Data Pipelines: Ensuring model inputs are clean (ETL)
hh_gui_modern.py	Front-end interface for non-technical users (Store Managers)	Tooling: Building internal dashboards for Ops teams

Logic Flow (Kowalski Protocol)
Ingest:
System reads raw .xlsx exports from POS systems.

Clean:
data_manager.py normalizes SKU formats and filters corrupted rows.

Analyze:
hh_logic.py calculates Sales Velocity (Burn Rate) per SKU.

Decide:
business_rules.py flags inventory status:

Critical: < 3 days supply (stockout imminent)
Warning: < 14 days supply (needs reordering)
Healthy: No immediate action required
Dead: No sales for the month
Cold: Low sales for the month
Hot: High sales for the month
Output:
Generates a formatted Purchase Order for vendor submission.

Future Roadmap
SQL Integration:
Migrate flat-file CSV storage to PostgreSQL for historical trend analysis.

Agentic Risk:
Implement LLM-based agents to parse unstructured vendor communications for supply chain disruptions.

API Integration.
